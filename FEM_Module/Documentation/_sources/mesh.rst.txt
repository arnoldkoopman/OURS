mesh module
===========

This module contains functions that deal with generating a finite element mesh.

The numbering of the nodes (black) and of the finite elements (red) is illustrated in the figure below.

    .. _element:
    .. figure:: ./_static/meshing.png
        :width: 600px
        :align: left
        :figclass: align-left

The nodes are numbered from the symmetry-axis outwards and from the top to the bottom. The elements however,
are numbered from the top to the bottom, from the symmetry-axis outward while staying within the same soil layer.
Ones all elements are numbered within one soil layer, then the elements in the layer below are numbered.

This numbering is introduced for efficiency reasons. The element properties remain equal within one column in one layer.
With this numbering the element matrices are only computed once for each column in each layer, and are subsequently used for each finite element in a column.
