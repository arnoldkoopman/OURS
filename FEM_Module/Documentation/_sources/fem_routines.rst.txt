fem\_routines module
====================

This module includes finite element functions :cite:`bathe_2006`. On finite element level there are functions that generate matrices and
vectors, and on global level there are functions that assemble the elemental components into one an overall system.

All routines are based on a linear axisymmetric element with a nodal numbering as illustrated in the figure below.
